## About

🔥🐦: Shared front-end components and utilities library for HathiTrust applications and web site.
## Built With
* Svelte
* Bootstrap
* Storybook
* Chromatic
* Vite
## Project Set Up

### Prerequisites
* For running storybook in this repository: node > 18
* For running in the babel repo: Docker or compatible container runtime
### Installation

Running just with storybook:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hathitrust/firebird-common
cd firebird-common
npm install
npm run storybook
```

That will let you develop and work on the components, but in order to see them in the context of the applications you will need to use https://github.com/hathitrust/babel. Setting up that repository will also check out and build firebird.

```bash
git clone https://github.com:hathitrust/babel
cd babel
./setup.sh
```

You can then start a container that will automatically rebuild the firebird components when they change:

```bash
docker compose up -d firebird
```
### Creating A Pull Request

1. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
2. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
3. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
4. Open a Pull Request

* TBD: review process with Chromatic
## Content Structure
This is where you explain the content structure, otherwise known as the Information Architecture (IA). There are a few parts to this, depending on how complicated and broad the project. Try to include relationships between files and services.

### Project Structure
```markdown
.
├── bin // Build and deployment support
└── src
    ├── assets // Static assets (for use at build time?)
    ├── js
    │   ├── components // Subdirectories for individual components and their tests
    │   ├── decorators // Support for specific storybook stories
    │   ├── designs    // Also components, but more for storybook - designs that get reused in HTML templates rather than as svelte components currently.
    │   └── lib        // Various utilities and functions used by the components
    ├── public         // fonts and images used by components
    └── scss           // Style sheet (SCSS) sources
        └── fontawesome // Vendored copy of fontawesome
```
## Design
* Examples already in storybook (this will eventually be our design system)
* Link to drive with all the logos and things?
* Figma file that's locked down?
* ???
* Probably it should just all be in storybook, this is the eventual design system...
## Functionality

Components for firebird are built with Svelte!

You can look at the components with Storybook! (see above)
See below for using the components in our applications ... 


You can start building a component by creating a directory in `src/js/components`  called e.g. `ComponentName` containing an `index.svelte` and `ComponentName.stories.js`. 

The `index.svelte` contains the component itself; see the [Svelte documentation](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte-components) on how components are written.

Storybook allows showing the component in isolation in different states and scenarios as you develop it; see the [Storybook documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories) on writing stories.

To see the storybook locally, run `npm run storybook` inside the repository and then go to `http://localhost:6006`. (Using storybook alongside babel is future work.)

The storybook is also the primary place for viewing and documenting use cases for the components.

### Styles

* `styles.scss` are styles used by anything that will use firebird: the web sites and applications rely on styles and variables set here.
* `apps.scss` has styles used only by the applications: catalog, mb, ls all use this via an `apps` class in their `body` tag.

## Usage - IN PROGRESS

This section describes how to use components.

In the HTML generated by an application, it should include:

```html
<script src="..."/>
```

* via `skeleton.xsl` for the babel apps (https://github.com/hathitrust/babel/blob/main/mdp-web/skeleton.xsl)
* Via ... something else ... for the catalog

See cookie consent banner work log for how you initailize the component in a svelte js file somewhere so it's available as a web component and then you can just do

```html
<hathi-website-header/>
```

or something like that.
## Tests - TODO
- This section will clearly state the test use cases that are being coverd.
- [X] Hello World
- [ ] Something Serious
## Hosting - TODO
- This section should outline the ideal environemt for hosting this application and it's intention.
## Resources - TODO
- This section should be used to keep track of any 3rd party resources used to help aid in the creation of this project.

## Configuration

* `HT.prefs.set` and `HT.prefs.get`
* configuring the various domains:
  * `HT.service_domain`
  * `HT.catalog_domain`
  * `HT.www_domain`
  * `HT.cookies_domain`

## Alerts

a.k.a. Outage Notifications

This is the data for outage notification alert banners. We will update the adjacent `alert.json` file when a notification should be deployed site-wide. This file will typically be empty, but will include the data (as shown in the exmample below) when a notification is needed.

## Alert types

### Default alert

This alert includes a title and all other details.

### Simple alert

This alert does not include a title. It should still include a 'type' and 'link'/'linkText'. The title should be an empty string, e.g. `"title": "",`

## Example

**Note:** The `id` should be unique to each alert because a cookie with the related ID is created when the banner is dismissed.

```json
{
    "title": "Outage: Incomplete search results",
    "message": "Users searching within the full text of all volumes will receive incomplete search results.",
    "link": "https://www.hathitrust.org/press-post/outage-incomplete-search-results/",
    "linkText": "See updates here",
    "type": "danger",
    "id": 20250219,
}
```

## On accessing `ping`

The `navbar_login_example.html` has a NOP handler for invoking the `ping` utility:

```html
  <script>
    function ping_handler(status) {};
  </script>
  <script src="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/ping"></script>
```

`ping` returns a JSONP response, invoking `ping_handler()` and the `LoginForm` component checks for the presence of `HT.login_status` to build its institution list.
